Welcome to another Tetris clone! 

To get the game running, you must have OpenFrameworks installed along with
the add-on ofxDatGui, which can be found [here.](https://braitsch.github.io/ofxDatGui/index.html#installation)   Instructions for using the OpenFrameworks project generator can be found [here.](http://openframeworks.cc/learning/01_basics/create_a_new_project/)

Note: When building the project in either XCode or Visual Studio, build in Release Mode. 

If you've played Tetris Friends before, the game controls are the same from there. Otherwise, the controls are displayed in-game.
