# Project Proposal
  For my final project I want to do a classic arcade game like Tetris, Breakout, or Pac-man. I had considered one of the more visual projects like a visualizer or something of that sort like in the 3d examples that OpenFrameworks provides, but it would require learning the math and concepts on top of doing the coding, so that would be better to leave for another time. 
  To make my game I would probably use one of the Graphics or Game Engine libraries [linked](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp) on the Piazza today or something from the [ofxAddons](http://ofxaddons.com/categories/17-game-engine), specifically one for 2D games. 
Rough Goals Outline:
1. Find a suitable engine and create basic functionality for general objects and collisions
2. Decide what game to make and start implementing the core game features.
3. Finish up the game and think about add-ons to make the game more full.

Updated Roadmap (4/24):
- 4/18: Finish up all piece movements. (mostly done) 
- 4/19: Implement timer-based falling. (need to start)
- 4/20: Implement piece collisions and row-clearing. (piece collisions almost done)
- 4/21: Implement Tetris extras (wall kicks, score, piece-saving, maybe spins, etc.)
- 4/22: Start working on required libraries (DatGUI, game sound)
- 4/24: Work on ghost pieces, colors, wall kicks, and game sound.
