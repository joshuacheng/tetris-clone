Week 1:
- trouble generating the project but it should be working now
- still deciding on a game, either between Tetris or Conway's Game of Life
- thinking about how to represent pieces and their rotation in Tetris is going to be one of the hardest
  challenges in this project
  - 4/18: Pieces are implemented and they can do basic rotation and side-to-side movement. 
          I decided to hard-code piece rotations in a large array so as to not deal with rotation algorithms for 
          such a small amount of pieces. As of right now, all of my work is being done on finishing 
          the base Tetris game before I add GUI elements or game sound. I will need to make sure to finish
          the game ASAP because GUI and/or game sound will be the libraries fulfilling my library requirement.
